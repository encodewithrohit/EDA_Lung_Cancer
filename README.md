**Objective :**

To aid in the global effort to understand and combat this disease, I am excited to do a comprehensive data analysis on Lung Cancer Dataset wherein we will investigate how different features relate to the target variable (LUNG_CANCER) to identify potential predictors. Also, detect any trends or patterns over age, time or other ordered features.
